# Project-Aurora


## Installation

Navigate to the `auth` folder and type in `npm run install-all`
This will run the npm install for both the front-end and backend

Once this is completed you will need to update the .ENV file. I've included  an example file. the DB_PW is your mongoDB password, this assumes the username is `admin`
the `SECRET` is whatever you want it to be. But this must be set to something before it will work

## Running Local Dev Server
Once you've completed the installation setps you just need to run the following command to start the front/backend.
`npm run dev`
